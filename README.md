# upnp-poc Lightweight introduction into using Intel UPNP Tools in .NET

- How to create a small device/service (Device Point)
- How to control the device/service (Control Point)
- How to abstract away the UPNP dependency and access the device through a .NET interface
- How to dynamically resolve devices/services in the form of .NET interfaces in the network

* note to self - add some more information about the concept of Zero Configuration Integration Proposal
which in essence proposes to expose software components as UPNP devices so that they can be tracked/controlled/monitored
from compatible UPNP control points/monitors

** add support/sample for simple/brokered and distributed authentication for UPNP
